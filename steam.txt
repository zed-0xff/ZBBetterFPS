[h1]ZBBetterFPS[/h1]

A comprehensive performance overhaul for Project Zomboid that optimizes rendering, game logic, and CPU usage. Unlike traditional mods, ZBBetterFPS uses low-level runtime patching to fix performance bottlenecks deep within the game engine.

[b]🚀 Key Optimizations:[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Smart Sprite Batching[/b]: Intelligently merges sprites and 3D models into fewer drawing commands, significantly reducing the load on your CPU.
[*] [b]Graphics State Caching[/b]: Suppresses redundant graphics commands to ensure your GPU only receives necessary updates.
[*] [b]Enhanced GPU Buffers[/b]: Increases internal render buffers to 1MB to reduce data transfer overhead between CPU and GPU.
[*] [b]Faster 3D Models & Shaders[/b]: Optimizes the rendering of characters, items, and terrain through advanced data caching.
[*] [b]Background CPU Throttling[/b]: Prevents the game from consuming 100% CPU when minimized or paused, keeping your PC cool while you're away.
[*] [b]Adjustable Render Distance[/b]: Fine-tune how many tiles are rendered to match your hardware's capabilities.
[*] [b]Streamlined Physics[/b]: Optimized math for object separation and physics updates to keep high-population areas running smoothly.
[/list]

[b]⚙️ Configurable Features:[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]IndieGL Optimization[/b]: Caches graphics states for smoother rendering.
[*] [b]RingBuffer Optimization[/b]: Larger GPU buffers for heavy scenes (Requires restart).
[*] [b]Render Distance[/b]: Adjust from 24x24 to 312x312 tiles (Default is ~152x152).
[*] [b]Background Throttling[/b]: Saves power and CPU when the game is not in focus.
[*] [b]Uncapped FPS Control[/b]: Choose between Default, Force Uncapped, or Force Capped.
[/list]

[b]⚠️ Important:[/b]
[b]A savegame reload is required[/b] after changing the [b]Render Distance[/b] setting for changes to take effect. The [b]RingBuffer[/b] optimization requires a full game restart.

[b]📦 Installation:[/b]
