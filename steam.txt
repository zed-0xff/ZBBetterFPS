Optimize FPS by decreasing the number of rendered tiles through configurable render distance settings.

[/list]

[b]What it does:[/b]
Allows you to reduce the render distance in Project Zomboid, which decreases the number of tiles rendered and can significantly improve FPS performance, especially on lower-end systems or in areas with many objects.

[b]Important:[/b]
[color=red]You must reload your savegame after changing the render distance setting for the changes to take effect.[/color] The render engine is initialized during the game load phase, so a savegame reload is required to apply the selected value.

[b]Development History:[/b]
Initially, I wanted to make ZBBetterFPS as an add-on to the original ZBetterFPS mod. However, maintaining compatibility with both the mod's and game's code resulted in the implementation being too fragile. As a result, I decided to make it a standalone, non-compatible implementation. Despite this, all credits go to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3423115544]BetterFPS_B42[/url] by Alree, which served as the inspiration for this mod.
