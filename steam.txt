[b]What it does:[/b]
Allows you to optimize FPS performance in Project Zomboid through two configurable options:
[list]
[*] [b]Render Distance[/b]: Adjust the number of rendered tiles to improve performance
[*] [b]Uncapped FPS[/b]: Control the uncapped FPS setting with tri-state configuration
[/list]

[b]Render Distance Options:[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Default[/b]: Uses the game's default calculation (based on your screen resolution, typically 152x152 tiles)
[*] [b]Minimum[/b]: 24x24 tiles
[*] [b]Maximum[/b]: 312x312 tiles
[*] [b]Mod Default[/b]: 104x104 tiles - optimized for ~95% screen coverage at 2336x1460 resolution on minimal zoom
[/list]

[b]Uncapped FPS Options:[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Default[/b]: Don't modify the uncapped FPS setting (leave it as configured in game options)
[*] [b]Force Uncapped[/b]: Enable uncapped FPS
[*] [b]Force Capped[/b]: Disable uncapped FPS
[/list]
The uncapped FPS setting takes effect immediately when applied through the mod options menu.

[b]Important:[/b]
[b]You must reload your savegame after changing the render distance setting for the changes to take effect.[/b] The render engine is initialized during the game load phase, so a savegame reload is required to apply the selected value.

[b]Development History:[/b]
Initially, I wanted to make ZBBetterFPS as an add-on to the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3423115544]BetterFPS_B42[/url]  mod. However, maintaining compatibility with both the mod's and game's code resulted in the implementation being too fragile. As a result, I decided to make it a standalone, non-compatible implementation. Despite this, all credits go to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3423115544]BetterFPS_B42[/url] by Alree, which served as the inspiration for this mod.
